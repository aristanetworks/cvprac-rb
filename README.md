# Cvprac
This is a template for developing a Rubygem.

To use this, first, find and replace all instances of `mygem` and
`Mygem` with your rubygem name.  Then replace `REPLACEME` with
the appropriate text.  When just starting out, please ensure that
the year in all license comments reflects the first year of work
on that file.

If you are developing an application, remove Gemfile.lock from the .gitignore
and commit it.  Otherwise, do not commit the Gemfile.lock.

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to
be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the
file `lib/mygem`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an
interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
